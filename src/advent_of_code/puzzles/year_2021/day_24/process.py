An ALU (arithmetic logic unit) is a 4D processing unit with four
registers - w, x, y and z, all initialised to 0 - and six instructions:

inp a - read an input and write to a.
add a b - add a to b and write to a.
mul a b - multiply a with b and write to a.
div a b - floor-divide a with b and write to a.
mod a b - get the remainder of a divided with b and write to a.
eql a b - if a equals b, write 1 to a, else write 0 to a.

You are given a program called MONAD that validates a 14 digit number
where each digit is 1-9. MONAD takes in 14 inputs corresponding to the
14 individual digits from left to right, and if the number is valid,
leaves the z register as 0.

Part 1
Find the greatest number accepted by MONAD.

Part 2
Find the smallest number accepted by MONAD.

Solution

MONAD is a program of 14 repeating chunks of instructions that follow the
below pattern:

inp w
mul x 0
add x z
mod x 26
div z {div_z}
add x {add_x}
eql x w
eql x 0
mul y 0
add y 25
mul y x
add y 1
mul z y
mul y 0
add y w
add y {add_y}
mul y x
add z y

where div_z is seven times as 1 and seven times as 26, add_x is an integer
where seven are greater than 10 and seven are 0 or less, and add_y is always
a positive integer.

z must always equal 0 at the very end.
There are three operations that change z:

div z {div_z}
mul z y
add z y

Let's consider the block of code that ends in "add z y", which is the last
operation of the chunk and therefore the program:

eql x w
eql x 0
...
mul y 0
add y w
add y {add_y}
mul y x
add z y

y is zeroed, and then either added to a w (which never changes), add_y
(which is a positive integer), or multiplied to with x (which is 0 or 1).
This is then added to z. So for z to be 0, since y cannot be positive,
x must be 0 to zero y. Which means that w must be equal to x in the "eql"
block at the very end.

Let's now also consider the "mul z y" block:

eql x w
eql x 0
mul y 0
add y 25
mul y x
add y 1
mul z y

When x is 1, y is 26 and z is multiplied by 26.
When x is 0, y is 1 and z is multiplied by 1.
It stands to reason, then than we want x to be equal to w as many times as
possible to limit the growth of z. z is divided by 26 only seven times, so we
can only let z be multiplied by 26 seven times.

Now, let's consider the code block that determines whether x is equal to w:

mul x 0
add x z
mod x 26
div z {div_z}
add x {add_x}
eql x w
eql x 0

x undergoes the modulo operator to be between 0 and 25. But then it is added to
add_x before undergoing the x == w check. However, in the seven times that add_x
is greater than 10, it is impossible for x to equal w as w is between 1-9 and never
gets changed.

This means, then, that x can only equal w the other seven times. And must equal w
the other seven times, in order to limit the growth of z and have a chance that z
equals 0 by the end.

The solution below recursively splits the program into the fourteen chunks, but it
also splits into the seven sections where x must be 0. At each of these larger sections,
we check to see if x is equal to 0, and then discard multiple overlapping options.
For example, for the same numeric outputs, if z is the same value at the end of a
section, we can keep either the greatest or smallest output (depending on part 1 vs 2)
and discard the rest. This greatly reduces the number of operations to check
overall.
